            'Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.',

            'Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally this radiation would escape into space, but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. These heat-trapping pollutants—specifically carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated gases—are known as greenhouse gases, and their impact is called the greenhouse effect.',

            'Curbing dangerous climate change requires very deep cuts in emissions, as well as the use of alternatives to fossil fuels worldwide. The good news is that countries around the globe have formally committed—as part of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement—to lower their emissions by setting new standards and crafting new policies to meet or even exceed those standards. The not-so-good news is that we’re not working fast enough. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists tell us that we need to reduce global carbon emissions by as much as 40 percent by 2030. For that to happen, the global community must take immediate, concrete steps: to decarbonize electricity generation by equitably transitioning from fossil fuel–based production to renewable energy sources like wind and solar; to electrify our cars and trucks; and to maximize energy efficiency in our buildings, appliances, and industries.',

            "Some gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer and thickening the Earth's blanket For each greenhouse gas, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per pound emitted, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming Earth.",

            'Drive Less \nIn November 2017 carbon dioxide emissions from transportation surpassed emissions from electricity generation as the top source of greenhouse gases.  Why? Electricity generation is shifting away from the use of coal to more renewable sources and natural gas. Going carless for a year could save about 2.6 tons of carbon dioxide, according to 2017 study from researchers at Lund University and the University of British Columbia — that’s a little more than a roundtrip transatlantic flight. How can you stop using a car? Try taking a train, bus or better yet, ride a bike.',

Think about it this way: If you use public transportation often, and fly home to visit family just occasionally, your carbon footprint might still be relatively sustainable, but if you drive and fly a lot, your emissions will be higher. If you can’t avoid flying, one way of making up for the emissions caused is to offset them by donating money to sustainable projects, such as supplying efficient stoves to rural homes, or projects which help farmers in India sell crop waste as biomass. Sometimes airlines will give you this option themselves',

            "Switch it Off \nTurn off the lights when natural light is sufficient and when you leave the room. It’s that simple!\n\nClimate Control\nKeep your temperature system on a moderate setting while you’re in the room.\n\nWasteful Windows\nUse your windows wisely! If your climate control system is on, shut them…if you need a little fresh air, turn off the heat or AC.\n\nMinimize Plug Load\nCut down the number of appliances you are running and you will save big on energy. For example, share your minifridge with roomates and minimize the number of printers in your office.\n\nPhantom Power\nDid you know that many electronics continue using energy even when powered down? This is true of any charger, television, printer, etc. Use a power strip to easily unplug these electronics when not in use.\n\nGive it a Rest\nPower your computer down when you’re away. A computer turned off uses at least 65% less energy than a computer left on or idle on a screen saver.\n\nTake the Stairs\nUse the stairs as often as possible. Elevators consume electricity. You, on the other hand, do not.\n\nLoaded Laundry\nOnly do full loads of laundry and use the bright colors cycle whenever possible.\n\nShorter Showers\nTry to take shorter showers. The less hot water you use, the less energy is needed to heat the water.\n\nSwitch to CFLs\nCompact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) use 75% less energy than incandescent and last up to 10 times longer.",
